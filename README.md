Inspired from this [blog post](https://krasimirtsonev.com/blog/article/implementing-an-async-queue-in-23-lines-of-code)

`1_myAsyncQueue.js` is my own implementation which has flaws such as code duplication

`2_betterAsyncQueue.js` fixs the flaws with recursion. This is similar to the implementation in the above blog post.
